A comprehensive toolkit for fetching real-time weather data, forecasts, and alerts using the OpenWeatherMap API. This toolkit enables AI agents to provide weather-based insights and activity suggestions.
# LLM usedL Clause and Grok

## üåü Features

- **Current Weather**: Get real-time weather conditions for any location
- **Weather Forecasts**: 5-day weather forecasts with daily summaries  
- **Weather Alerts**: Active weather warnings and emergency alerts
- **Agent Integration**: Ready-to-use with AI frameworks like LangChain
- **Environment Support**: Automatic API key loading from .env files
- **Production Ready**: Rate limiting, comprehensive error handling, full type safety

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **OpenWeatherMap API Key** (free): Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. **Python 3.10+**
3. **uv package manager**: Follow [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the weather toolkit directory
cd weather

# Set up the development environment  
uv venv --seed -p 3.13

# Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks
make install

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project:

```bash
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from weather import get_current_weather, get_forecast, get_weather_alerts

# Get current weather
weather = get_current_weather("London, UK")
print(f"Temperature: {weather['temperature']}¬∞C")
print(f"Condition: {weather['description']}")

# Get 3-day forecast  
forecast = get_forecast("Paris, FR", days=3)
for day in forecast:
    print(f"{day['date']}: {day['temperature_min']}¬∞C - {day['temperature_max']}¬∞C")

# Check for weather alerts
alerts = get_weather_alerts("Miami, US") 
for alert in alerts:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {alert['event']}: {alert['description']}")
```

## üß™ Development

The Makefile provides several helpful commands:

- `make install` - Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks
- `make test` - Run all tests with pytest
- `make coverage` - Generate coverage report
- `make check` - Run linting and type checking
- `make clean-build` - Clean build artifacts

### Running Tests

```bash
make test              # Run all tests
make coverage          # Generate coverage report
make check             # Run linting and type checking
```

### Verify Local Installation

Your toolkit should be installed locally from the `make install` command. Verify it's properly registered:

```bash
arcade show --local
```

### Test Your Tools Locally

Serve your toolkit locally with the Arcade CLI:

```bash
# From the parent directory (where worker.toml is located)
cd ..
arcade serve --reload
```

Visit http://localhost:8002/worker/health to see that your worker is running.

### Running Evaluations

```bash
uv run python evals/eval_weather.py
```

### Demo Applications

```bash
# Simple demo (basic toolkit usage)
uv run python demo/weather_agent.py

# Advanced LangChain demo (requires optional dependencies)
uv add langchain langchain-openai langchain-community
uv run python demo/langchain_agent.py
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy to Arcade Cloud

Deploy directly to Arcade's cloud:

```bash
# From the parent directory (where worker.toml is located)
cd ..
arcade deploy
```

Verify deployment:
```bash
arcade worker list
```

### Package and Publish

1. **Clean previous builds:**
```bash
make clean-build
```

2. **Bump version (if updating):**
```bash
make bump-version
```

3. **Build package:**
```bash
make build
```

4. **Publish to PyPI:**
```bash
uv publish --token YOUR_PYPI_TOKEN_HERE
```
